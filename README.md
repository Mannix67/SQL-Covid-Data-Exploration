# SQL-Covid-Data-Exploration

This project explain 

Began by looking at total cases v total deaths. by dividing total deaths/ total cases X100 to get the per centage chance of dying from Covid 19.This enabled me to 
show the likelyhood of dying in each country. in this instance i looked at the united states.
