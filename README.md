# SQL-Covid-Data-Exploration

the goal of this project was to put into practise features on SQL that i have learned through online courses. The main features i wanted to use where 
Select, From, where , group by, having, order by, join analysing and joining tables. I used a covid 19 data set from kaggle and divided it up on excel for both deaths and vaccination numbers. I then set out to explore the data and use all the specified features. I firstly dealth with death figures. The data containted death and population figures from every country around the world. The data is from january 2020 to may 2021. 

Began by looking at total cases v total deaths. by dividing total deaths/ total cases X100 to get the per centage chance of dying from Covid 19.This enabled me to 
show the likelyhood of dying in each country. in this instance i looked at the united states.

I then went on to look at Total cases V total population ie highest infection rate per population. Andora has the highest cases per population although this is expected due to it's small population size. Montenegro and czech republic are the worst performing nations above 1 
million people. USA is the worst performing nation above 10 million people.

Here, i made a table that gives the total deaths of the world and each continent.

deaths/cases X100 to get mortality rate on every day since january 2020 for each country.

total vaccination v total population. used join function to join the two data sets together to put them into a table.
